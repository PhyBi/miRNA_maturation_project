Instructions to obtain the code: Click on the 'Code' menu (green button) and select the 'Download Zip' option from the drop-down menu. Then extract it to any directory on your desktop.

Instructions to run the code: Open the f90 code in an editor. Model parameter values and initial molecule numbers are already given in the code. The user can manipulate those values according to their need. Execute the code using the Fortran 90 compiler. After execution, two data files will be created, 'parameter.txt' and 'output.dat'. Here, 'parameter.txt' will contain the model parameter values given as input, and 'output.dat' will contain the molecule numbers of mRNA, protein, miRNA, and mRNA-miRNA complex at any time up to stopping time.
